# What is MixedRealityToolkit

MRTK is a Microsoft Driven open source project. MRTK-Unity...
* Provides the **basic building blocks for unity development on HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality, and OpenVR**.
* Showcases UX best practices with **UI controls that match Windows Mixed Reality and HoloLens Shell**. 
* **Enables rapid prototyping** via in-editor simulation that allows you to see changes immediately.
* **Supports a wide range of platforms**, including
  * Microsoft HoloLens
  * Microsoft HoloLens 2
  * Microsoft Immersive headsets (IHMD)
  * Windows Mixed Reality headsets
  * OpenVR headsets (HTC Vive / Oculus Rift)
    
* Is **extensible**. Provides devs ability to swap out core components and extend the framework.

# Examples and QuickStart scenes

One radical change to the Mixed Reality Toolkit vNext, will be the standards and approaches to real world example scenes.

New examples will follow strict guidelines, such as:

* Each example must have a use and demonstrate a real world test case (no tests).
* Each example will use a standardized template, so all examples have the same look and feel.
* Each sample will be fully documented, detailing both the use case it is demonstrating and how to implement the features demonstrated.

> Check the "Work In Progress" section of the [Windows Mixed Reality - vNext SDK](MRTK-SDK.md) for a peek at the first new example.
