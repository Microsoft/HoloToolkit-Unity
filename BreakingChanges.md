# Breaking Changes

## In progress
We are currently restructuring the Toolkit to align with the MixedRealityToolkit naming, this includes:
 - Folder names
 - Namespaces
 - Project structure
As this is a major breaking change, we are taking advantage of this update to also "clean house" of old obsolete code and restructure elements.
