# HoloToolkit-Examples

#### When considering an example:

1. Examples should not be like unit tests which exist in the Tests folder of each feature folder.
2. Examples are bigger ideas which use the HoloToolkit or not to show developers how they can solve problems on HoloLens using Unity.
3. Examples that are more of an end-end app, do not fit into the HoloToolkit-Examples folder.
4. Examples that are not maintained regularly will be deprecated.

#### When adding an example:

1. Create a new folder under HoloToolkit-Examples and give it a name that best describes your project.
2. You can add your Unity Assets and Projects Settings folders under that folder.
3. Ensure you add a README.md so developers can read about the purpose and steps to run your example code.
